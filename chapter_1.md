- Historically, most computers have had one processor, with a <span style="color: purple">single processing unit or core</span>, and this remains true for many desktop machines today. Such a machine can really only perform one task at a time, but it can switch between tasks many times per second. By doing a bit of one task and then a bit of another and so on, it appears that the tasks are happening concurrently. This is called <span style="color: purple">task switching</span>. We still talk about concurrency with such systems; because the task switches are so fast, you canâ€™t tell at which point a task may be suspended as the processor switches to another one.

- Computers containing multiple processors have been used for servers and high performance computing tasks for a number of years, and now computers based on processors with more than one core on a single chip (multicore processors) are becoming increasingly common as desktop machines too. Whether they have multiple processors or multiple cores within a processor (or both), these computers are capable of genuinely running more than one task in parallel. We call this <span style="color: purple">hardware concurrency. </span>
